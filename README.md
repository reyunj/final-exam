Design Decisions:
Consistent Branding: I maintained a consistent color scheme, typography, and overall branding throughout the website. Consistency helps in creating a professional and trustworthy impression.

Challenges Faced and How I'm Overcome:
Limited Technical Knowledge: If I was a beginner, one of the major challenges might have been a lack of technical knowledge. To overcome this, I would have started with online tutorials and courses to learn the basics of web development. Technical Issues: Technical glitches and bugs are common, especially for beginners. I would have been proactive in troubleshooting issues by searching for solutions online.

Overall, while building a website as a beginner can be challenging, dedication to learning and seeking assistance from online resources and communities can help overcome these challenges and create a successful website.
