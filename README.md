<h1>Design Decisions:</h1>
<li>Consistent Branding: I maintained a consistent color scheme, typography, and overall branding throughout the website.</li>
    Consistency helps in creating a professional and trustworthy impression.

<h1>Challenges Faced and How I'm Overcome:</h1>

<li>Limited Technical Knowledge: If I was a beginner, one of the major challenges might have been a lack of technical knowledge.
To overcome this, I would have started with online tutorials and courses to learn the basics of web development. </li>
<li>Technical Issues: Technical glitches and bugs are common, especially for beginners. I would have been proactive in troubleshooting issues by searching for solutions online.</li>

<h3>Overall, while building a website as a beginner can be challenging, dedication to learning and seeking assistance from online resources and communities can help overcome these challenges and create a beginner website. Although not all design is copy but I'll try making this exam my very best.</h3>
