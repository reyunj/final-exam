<h1 align="center">Design Decisions:</h1>
<li>Consistent Branding: I maintained a consistent color scheme, typography, and overall branding throughout the website.Consistency helps in creating a professional and trustworthy impression.</li>
<li>Responsiveness:Decide if my website should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile devices). A responsive design is essential for reaching a broader audience.</li>
<li>Content Layout:Plan how my content will be laid out on each page. Use grids and whitespace to create a clean and organized appearance.</li>
<li>User Experience (UX):Prioritize user-friendly design. Make sure navigation is intuitive, and pages load quickly. Aim for a seamless and enjoyable user experience.</li>
<li></li>Testing and Feedback:Regularly test my website on different devices and browsers. Seek feedback from others to identify areas for improvement.</li>

<h1 align="center">Challenges Faced and How I'm Overcome:</h1>

<li>Limited Technical Knowledge: If I was a beginner, one of the major challenges might have been a lack of technical knowledge.
To overcome this, I would have started with online tutorials and courses to learn the basics of web development. </li>
<li>Technical Issues: Technical glitches and bugs are common, especially for beginners. I would have been proactive in troubleshooting issues by searching for solutions online.</li>

<h2>Overall, while building a website as a beginner can be challenging, dedication to learning and seeking assistance from online resources and communities can help overcome these challenges and create a beginner website. Although not all design is copy but I'll try making this exam my very best.</h2>
